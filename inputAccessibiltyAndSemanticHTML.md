# Semantic HTML
## What is semantic HTML?
Elements that clearly answer the question "what purpose or role does that HTML element have?" to both the developer and the browser.  
HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling.  
## Benefits of writing semantic markup  
* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.  
* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page (aids in accessibility)
* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes (readability)
* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated (readability)
* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming  
When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?"  

## Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:
* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<details>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<figure>`
* `<footer>`
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<mark>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
* `<summary>`
* `<time>  `

## Accessibility (A11y)  

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible, by developing content to be accessible, no matter an individual's physical and cognitive abilities and how they access the web.  
Websites have to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  
### Benefits
* Semantic HTML, which improves accessibility, also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
* Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
* Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users or those on low network speed. 
* Itâ€™s required by the law in some places.

    * Website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security.
