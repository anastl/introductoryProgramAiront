# HTML  
## Definition
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.  

# XHTML 
XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language. It is a cross between HTML and XML language. XHTML is almost identical to HTML but it is stricter than HTML. XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application. It is supported by all major browsers.

# Meta tags
Meta tags are specific snippets of text and image content that provide a summary for a webpage. Often meta tag data shows up whenever someone shares a link on social media, in messaging, or in chat softwares. In addition meta tags can contain information to help search engines and other technical services scan your site to figure out what it’s all about and whether or not it’s authentic.  
`<meta>` tags always go inside the `<head>` element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
