# SEO  
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results. Search engines crawl the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found.  

Crawlers follow rules, if you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue.  

SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents. SEO methods fall into three broad categories:  
* Technical: Tag the content using semantic HTML. When exploring the website, crawlers should only find the content you want indexed.
* Copywriting: Write content using your visitors' vocabulary. Use text as well as images so that crawlers can understand the subject. 
* Popularity: You get most traffic when other established sites link to your site.
You must ensure that your crawlers/bots get the closest experience to that of your user’s, and that your site (and any fetches that need to be executed) loads within 5 seconds or less.  

# DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. It represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.  

The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document—such as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree. With them, you can change the document's structure, style, or content.
